<h1>Project-4: Named Entity Recognition - Clinical Data Extraction</h1>
<p>Named Entity Recognition (NER) 
  <br>— also referred to as named entity extraction or identification — 
    <br>is an extraction technique that automatically identifies key information from text data and classifies 
    them into predefined categories. 
    <br>
    It is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and 
    classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, 
    organisations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. 
    <br>
    In this article we will take example of clincal data and discuss how a NER model can be built using SpaCy 
    and relevant entities are extracted as per the requirement.</p>
