<h1>Project-2: Multi-Class Classification of Research Articles</h1>
<p>Researchers have access to large online archives of scientific articles. 
    As a consequence, finding relevant articles has become more and more difficult. 
    <br>
    Tagging or topic modelling provides a way to give clear token of identification to research articles 
    which facilitates recommendation and search process in a much better way. 
    <br>
    Goal here is to predict the tags for each article based on the abstract words(NLP).</p>
