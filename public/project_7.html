<h1>Project-7: Automatic License Plate Detection and Number Display</h1>
<p>Object Detection has become a key area, in the field of Artificial Intelligence(AI) and Machine Learning(ML). 
    <br>Along with Object detection and object recognition there is an area where you need to recognize the 
    Content within the object detected or recognized.
    <br>This area has a lot of applications for example vehicle number plate detection, 
    scanning the bar code and get the details, take photos of large shipping containers and get the required plate information, 
    or license details, etc.
    <br>In this case study we will focus more on Automatic License plate detection and 
    displaying the vehicle number present in it.</p>
